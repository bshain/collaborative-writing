Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom a long time ago, there was a mouse named Samson.
Samson had three brothers named Daryl. No one was sure why they had the same name but it was worth it for an obscure joke
Each Daryl was to be addressed in a different tone, in order to distinguish which one was being called. 
On a gloomy December morning, two of three Daryls died in a tragic figure skating accident.
After their demise, both Samson & Daryl were devastated and things were never the same around the once cheerful kingdom.
Secretly, everyone was thankful that two of the three Daryls died, because now they didn't have distinguish the remaining Daryl in falsetto.
This was extremely hard on the vocal chords and was interfering with Samsonâ€™s dreams of joining an an acapella group.
